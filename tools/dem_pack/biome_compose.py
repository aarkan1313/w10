r"""Biome composition layer (Fork B): blend the OUTPUTS of distinct biome recipes at boundaries.

Knows nothing about which recipes exist — it takes per-recipe height fields + a weight field and
composes one height. blend_mode is tunable: 'height_favored' (primary; bias toward the locally
higher-relief recipe so structure stays crisp through the band) or 'field' (cheap lerp fallback).
Decided + tuned by render-first probes (see the spec's BLEND PROBE banners). Defaults baked from
the clash tuning sweep: favor_strength=2.0 + a narrow transition band give the crispest natural
transition (the band width itself is owned by the grammar/weight-field, not this config).
